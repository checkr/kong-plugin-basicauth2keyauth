# Kong plugin - basicauth2keyauth

## Introduction

A lot of current APIs set api_key as the username in basic_auth with empty password. For example,

```
# Example from https://docs.checkr.com/#report

curl -X GET \
     https://api.checkr.com/v1/reports/4722c07dd9a10c3985ae432a \
     -u 83ebeabdec09f6670863766f792ead24d61fe3f9:

```

In order for Kong to correctly handle it, basicauth2keyauth maps the the api_key in basic auth to a normal header key.

```
config.key_name_in_header  -> specified key name in the headers
config.sha256_enabled      -> whether to run sha256 on the basic auth username (api_key)
config.hide_credentials    -> whether to hide the original basic auth for upstream services
```
